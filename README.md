# Conway-s-Game-Of-Life
- This is my implementation of Conway's Game Of Life
- I spent 5 hours making this (this is my first attempt
  so it is likely to be very inefficient). Most of that
  time I spent not realising that all changes in the
  game have to be done simultaneously and thus needing
  2 boards, an old and a new which get replaced every
  frame/generation - I was just using one board.

### NOTES
  
  - When running the program, make sure to run it in 
    fullscreen mode (alt+enter for cmd).
